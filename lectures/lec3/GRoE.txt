Given variables b and a:
b = a copies all the bits from a to b

In java, always pass by value i.e. always copy the bits to a new scope

8 primitive types
1 reference type


* Declaration of array: int[] a; (creates a 64 bit box to store the reference aka address of the array)
No actual objects at this stage

* Instantiating array: using new keyword: new int[]{0,1,2};
Object is instantiated, but is anonymous because we haven't assigned a name

* Decl, inst, assignment at the same time
int[] a = new int[]{0,1,2};

If we lose the address, we lose the object too because there's no way to retrieve it without knowing the address.
The object will then be consumed by the garbage collector
